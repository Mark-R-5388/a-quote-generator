# What I Made

This was a simple quote generator just using the fetch function. Getting better using the async await and promise web.
My main goal was just to get better using the feth api.
Loading the quote and author when the window loads and allow it t randomly change with the click of the button.
All were a success.

# What I learned

Honestly, I had a good idea on how to use the fetch api and with promises but there were some little details that go a long way.
The asspect of that fetch returns a promise, I know it is a main detail, always seemed to leave my brain as soon as I would work with them.

# My Biggest Takeway

Code structure is key, I used to get frustrated and would try everything I could to make a block of code work. So a simple 2-5 line code answer became a 20 line mess.
But I have learned to better debug and really think about the logic in my code now.
This has paid off the most.

# What I used

HTML, CSS, JavaScript
